# Startup-Success-Prediction-

Problem Statement:
What is the framing question of your analysis and what the purpose of the
model/system you plan to build?

9 out of 10 startups fail (source: Startup Genome). This means that investing in
a startup is a risky matter so to assist the investors the factors impacting the
success of a startup need to be determined. The following question for this
analysis is:

What are the most relevant variables that can be used to predict the success
of the startup?
The main goal of building the model is to predict the status of a startup.

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
- Investors
- Entrepreneurs

Data Description:
The dataset used is “Start Up Investments” from Crunchbase which is a
platform for finding business information about private and public
companies. The dataset is acquired through a secondary source which is
Kaggle.
The data set contains 49438 rows, each row of the dataset represents a
startup company with 39 features such as: name, category list, market,
funding total in USD, country, funding rounds number, round A-H series
funding and the target feature for this analysis: status.
Upon initial view, the dataset seems imbalanced as the data contains %6
acquired startups, %5 closed and above 80% operating startups.

Tools:
The tools used for this project will include:
1-Python3: as the main programming language used
2-Jupyter: as the IDE for python
3-Numpy: to manipulate the dataset
4-Pandas: to clean and preprocess the dataset
5-Matplotlib: to visualize the dataset
6-Seaborn: to visualize the dataset
7- sklearn: for feature selection and modeling
